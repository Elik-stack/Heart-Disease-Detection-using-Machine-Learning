# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihoodof heart disease based on patient health indicators. Early detection of cardiovascular disease can help in timely medical intervention and prevention of severe outcomes.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient medical records with the following features:

Column	Description
age	Age of the patient (years)
sex	Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp	Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
trestbps	Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
chol	Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
fbs	Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl) (1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T abnormality, 2 = probable/definite LV hypertrophy)
thalach	Maximum heart rate achieved
exang	Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
ca	Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal	Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
target	Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = no disease, 1 = disease present)
